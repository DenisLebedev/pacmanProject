# pacmanProject
To make sure that the game run perfectly please add the file levelsPen.csv to pacmanProject\Pacman\PacManGame\bin\Windows\x86\Debug
because GitHub does not save the current folder. Also, right clic on the "Solution 'Pacman'", open the properties, choose in the Single startup project PacManGame. These changes will allow you to run the game. Github does not save them when we push so be careful do to all these steps. 

Moreover, you can make your own level! Just use the same name as the previous csv file and place the right letters. You can only place walls around like a box else an exception gonna be thrown. 

Ghost:
Ghosts are dumb, but it is made on purpose for young people. Be careful ghosts are faster than pacman, but slower than him when Pacman takes an energizer.

Symbol:
w: wall
p: pellet (points)
e: energizer (allow you to chase ghost)
P: pacman start position (please only use one)
1,2,3,4: each number represent a ghost and only maximum 4 of 4 ghosts is allowed
x: the pen where our ghosts gonna be if they are eated.
m: empty tile in the game.
